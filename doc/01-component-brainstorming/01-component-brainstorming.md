# Portfolio Part 1: Component Brainstorming

- **Name**: Prudhvi Adari
- **Dot Number**: adari.6
- **Due Date**: 2/6/2026 @ 12:40 PM

## Assignment Overview

The overall goal of the portfolio project is to have you design and implement
your own OSU component. There are no limits to what you choose to design and
implement, but your component must fit within the constraints of our software
sequence discipline. In other words, the component must extend from Standard and
must include both a kernel and a secondary interface.

Because this is a daunting project, we will be providing you with a series of
activities to aid in your design decisions. For example, the point of this
assignment is to help you brainstorm a few possible components and get some
feedback. For each of these components, you will need to specify the high-level
design in terms of the software sequence discipline. In other words, you will
describe a component, select a few kernel methods for your component, and select
a few secondary methods to layer on top of your kernel methods.

You are not required to specify contracts at this time. However, you are welcome
to be as detailed as you'd like. More detail means you will be able to get more
detailed feedback, which may help you decide which component to ultimately
implement.

## Assignment Checklist

To be sure you have completed everything on this assignment, we have littered
this document with TODO comments. You can browse all of them in VSCode by
opening the TODOs window from the sidebar. The icon looks like a tree and will
likely have a large number next to it indicating the number of TODOS. You'll
chip away at that number over the course of the semester. However, if you'd
like to remove this number, you can disable it by removing the following
line from the `settings.json` file:

```json
"todo-tree.general.showActivityBarBadge": true,
```

Which is not to be confused with the following setting that adds the counts
to the tree diagram (you may remove this one as well):

```json
"todo-tree.tree.showCountsInTree": true,
```

## Assignment Learning Objectives

Without learning objectives, there really is no clear reason why a particular
assessment or activity exists. Therefore, to be completely transparent, here is
what we're hoping you will learn through this particular aspect of the portfolio
project. Specifically, students should be able to:

1. Integrate their areas of interest in their personal lives and/or careers with
   their knowledge of software design
2. Determine the achievablility of a software design given time constraints
3. Design high-level software components following the software sequence
   discipline

## Assignment Rubric: 10 Points

Again, to be completely transparent, most of the portfolio project, except the
final submission, is designed as a formative assessment. Formative assessments
are meant to provide ongoing feedback in the learning process. Therefore,
the rubric is designed to assess the learning objectives *directly* in a way
that is low stakes—meaning you shouldn't have to worry about the grade. Just
do good work.

Below is further rationale/explanation for the rubric items above:

1. Each design must align with your personal values and long-term
   goals. Because the goal of this project is to help your build out a
   portfolio, you really ought to care about what you're designing. We'll give
   you a chance to share your personal values, interests, and long-term goals
   below.
2. Each design must be achievable over the course of a single
   semester. Don't be afraid to design something very small. There is no shame
   in keeping it simple.
3. Each design must fit within the software sequence discipline. In
   other words, your design should expect to inherit from Standard, and it
   should contain both kernel and secondary methods. Also, null and aliasing
   must be avoided, when possible. The methods themselves must also be in
   justifiable locations, such as kernel or secondary.

## Pre-Assignment

My interests are technology and medicine in a broad sense, but more specifically, I'n interested in AI and robotics. I intend to either become a doctor or a well-established robotic engineer who would be able to seamlessly integrate AI models into robots so that the models can interact and learn in the real world and in real time. My hobbies include but aren't limited to music, video games, watching shows (like anime), and reading books (currently leaning toward manga and novels).

## Assignment

As previously stated, you are tasked with brainstorming 3 possible components.
To aid you in this process, we have provided [some example components][example-components]
that may help you in your brainstorming. All of these components were made at
some point by one of your peers, so you should feel confident that you can
accomplish any of them.

There is no requirement that you use any of the components listed above.
If you want to model something else, go for it! Very common early object
projects usually attempt to model real-world systems like banks, cars,
etc. Make of this whatever seems interesting to you, and keep in mind that
you're just brainstorming right now. You do not have to commit to anything.

**Note**: Sometimes students will already know what they want to design
and will feel forced to make one-off designs for components they'll never
build. If that's you, you may submit three different designs for the same
component (rather than three different components). This will strengthen your
final design because you'll have an opportunity to think about different ways of
organizing the API. As an example, later in the course, you will see a tree
component that doesn't work by accessing the children through aliases but rather
by assembling and disassembling the tree. You will also see a variety of
list-like components that have different ways of manipulating the data. Think
about different ways you might allow a client to manipulate your component.

### Example Component

To help you brainstorm a few components, we've provided an example below of a
component you already know well: NaturalNumber. We highly recommend that you
mirror the formatting as close as possible in your designs. By following this
format, we can be more confident that your designs will be possible.

- Example Component: `NaturalNumber`
  - **Description**:
    - The purpose of this component is to model a non-negative
      integer. Our intent with this design was to keep a simple kernel that
      provides the minimum functionality needed to represent a natural number.
      Then, we provide more complex mathematical operations in the secondary
      interface.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - `void multiplyBy10(int k)`: multiplies `this` by 10 and adds `k`
    - `int divideBy10()`: divides `this` by 10 and reports the remainder
    - `boolean isZero()`: reports whether `this` is zero
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - `void add(NaturalNumber n)`: adds `n` to `this`
    - `void subtract(NaturalNumber n)`: subtracts `n` from `this`
    - `void multiply(NaturalNumber n)`: multiplies `this` by `n`
    - `NaturalNumber divide(NaturalNumber n)`: divides `this` by `n`, returning
      the remainder
    - ...
  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, basically all OSU components have to be mutable as long as they
        inherit from Standard. `clear`, `newInstance`, and `transferFrom` all
        mutate `this`.
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - No. All methods work with integers or other NaturalNumbers.
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - Yes. NaturalNumber is base 10, and we track that in a constant called
          `RADIX`.
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes. The kernel methods `multiplyBy10` and `divideBy10` can be used to
        manipulate our natural number as needed. For example, to implement
        `increment`, we can trim the last digit off with `divideBy10`, add 1 to
        it, verify that the digit hasn't overflown, and multiply the digit back.
        If the digit overflows, we reset it to zero and recursively call
        `increment`.

Keep in mind that the general idea when putting together these layered designs
is to put the minimal implementation in the kernel. In this case, the kernel is
only responsible for manipulating a digit at a time in the number. The secondary
methods use these manipulations to perform more complex operations like
adding two numbers together.

Also, keep in mind that we don't know the underlying implementation. It would be
completely reasonable to create a `NaturalNumber1L` class which layers the
kernel on top of the existing `BigInteger` class in Java. It would also be
reasonable to implement `NaturalNumber2` on top of `String` as seen in
Project 2. Do not worry about your implementations at this time.

On top of everything above, there is no expectation that you have a perfect
design. Part of the goal of this project is to have you actually use your
component once it's implemented to do something interesting. At which point, you
will likely refine your design to make your implementation easier to use.

### Component Designs

> Please use this section to share your designs.

- Component Design #1: Patient
  - **Description**:
    - This component is supposed to model a patient and their unique medical data in one structured area for organization and easy access. The kernel should allow the client to access and, if needed, modify patient attributes while the secondary interface supports high-level health updates.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - void setAttribute(Attribute a, String value)
    - String getAttribute(Attribute a)
    - boolean hasAttribute(Attribute a)
    - void removeAttribute(Attribute a)
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - int age()
    - Set allergies()
    - void updateVitals(Vitals v)
    - double height()
    - double bmi()
  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, patient data can change and update over time.
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - Yes, Map.Pair seems especially useful for this kind of area where attributes need pairing with values as per what the patient exhibits over time. Otherwise, a Set could be used to list patient attributes without repeats. I could also make attribute and vitals classes.
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - I don't know.
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Most of the secondary methods I made like age, height, and bmi are implementable via hasAttribute and getAttribute.

- Component Design #2: NeuralNode
  - **Description**:
    - This component should be designed to represent a single node in a simple feed-forward neural network. The kernel is designed to store and manipulate weights and biases, while the secondary interface should allow for more interactions with the weights and biases as well as training method help.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - setWeights(Sequence<Double> w)
    - setBias(double B)
    - Sequence<Double> weights()
    - double bias()
    - double evaluate(Sequence<Double> inputs)
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - weightedSum(Sequence<Double> inputs)
    - relu(Sequence<Double> inputs)
    - sigmoid(Sequence<Double> inputs)
    - randomizeWeights(Sequence<Double> inputs)
  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, aside from OSU convention, as nodes tend to modified often during learning cycles for a model, making them immutable would only make the node more of a pain to use than less.
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - I don't know but it probably could use Sequence to store all the weights in one data structor or Map.Pair if weights need special pairings per dimension.
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - I don't know.
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes, weights() and bias() can be used to implement weightedSum, as a general weighted sum in a neural network is just the cross product of the weights and bias.

- Component Design #3: TimedInputQueue
  - **Description**:
    - Models a sequence of input events, each associated with a timestamp and input type. The kernel supports insertion and removal of events, while secondary methods provide filtering and basic temporal analysis. I just thought it'd be cool to build game bots that play like people in video games.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - void enqueue(InputType t, double time)
    - InputType dequeue()
    - boolean isEmpty()
    - int size()
    - Map.Pair<Double, InputType> front()
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - double duration()
    - InputType mostFrequent()
    - boolean moreUsed(InputType a, InputType b)
    - TimedInputQueue filter(InputType t)
    - TimedInputQueue filterbyTime(double startTime, double endTime) with default argument values of start of queue and end of queue timings if needed for single argument calls.
    - void clearOld(double cutoffTime)
  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, input can come in at any time and become irrelevant after some time as well.
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - Maybe Queue and Map.Pair
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - Unsure, but I might have to define common InputTypes beforehand.
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes, the secondary methods here have the most amount of complexity among the three. However, using enqueue

## Post-Assignment

The following sections detail everything that you should do once you've
completed the assignment.

### Changelog

At the end of every assignment, you should update the
[CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) file found in the root of the project folder.
Since this is likely the first time you've done this, we would recommend
browsing the existing file. It includes all of the changes made to the portfolio
project template. When you're ready, you should delete this file and start your
own. Here's what I would expect to see at the minimum:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/) of
the following form: YYYY.0M.0D.

## YYYY.MM.DD

### Added

- Designed a <!-- insert name of component 1 here --> component
- Designed a <!-- insert name of component 2 here --> component
- Designed a <!-- insert name of component 3 here --> component
```

Here `YYYY.MM.DD` would be the date of your submission, such as 2024.04.21.

You may notice that things are nicely linked in the root CHANGELOG. If you'd
like to accomplish that, you will need to make GitHub releases after each pull
request merge (or at least tag your commits). This is not required.

In the future, the CHANGELOG will be used to document changes in your
designs, so we can gauge your progress. Please keep it updated at each stage
of development.

### Submission

If you have completed the assignment using this template, we recommend that
you convert it to a PDF before submission. If you're not sure how, check out
this [Markdown to PDF guide][markdown-to-pdf-guide]. However, PDFs should be
created for you automatically every time you save, so just double check that
all your work is there before submitting. For future assignments, you will
just be submitting a link to a pull request. This will be the only time
you have to submit any PDFs.

### Peer Review

Following the completion of this assignment, you will be assigned three
students' component brainstorming assignments for review. Your job during the
peer review process is to help your peers flesh out their designs. Specifically,
you should be helping them determine which of their designs would be most
practical to complete this semester. When reviewing your peers' assignments,
please treat them with respect. Note also that we can see your comments, which
could help your case if you're looking to become a grader. Ultimately, we
recommend using the following feedback rubric to ensure that your feedback is
both helpful and respectful (you may want to render the markdown as HTML or a
PDF to read this rubric as a table).
